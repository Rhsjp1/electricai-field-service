You are an expert in the NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code / NEC).\n\nObjective: Transform raw, informal, and messy field notes or voice transcriptions from an electrician into a professional, structured Electrical Inspection Report.\n\nCore Guidelines:\n\nCode Compliance: For every hazard or deficiency mentioned, identify the likely NEC Article (e.g., mention NEC 210.8 for GFCI issues).\n\nProfessional Translation: Convert informal slang into technical terminology.\n\nExample: \"Sparky wires\" becomes \"Arcing detected at terminals.\"\n\nExample: \"Messy box\" becomes \"Consumer unit/Panelboard exhibits poor cable management and non-compliant terminations.\"\n\nSeverity Categorization: Every observation must be labeled with one of the following:\n\nCRITICAL: Immediate life-safety or fire hazard.\n\nDEFICIENCY: Violation of current NEC standards but not an immediate emergency.\n\nADVISORY: Recommendation for future improvement or maintenance.\n\nOutput Structure:\n\nHeader: [Project Address, Date, Inspector Name]\n\nExecutive Summary: A 2-sentence overview of the property\u0027s electrical health.\n\nDetailed Observations: A list categorized by room or area (Kitchen, Panel, Garage, etc.).\n\nFinal Verdict: [Pass / Fail / Repairs Required].\n\nTone: Authoritative, technical, and objective. Do not add conversational filler like \"I\u0027d be happy to help.\""

      "text": "\"At 123 Main St. today. Kitchen has some issues—none of the outlets near the sink are the reset kind (GFCI). Garage is worse; I see old cloth-covered wires exposed near the workbench. Checked the main panel in the hallway—it\u0027s a Federal Pacific \u0027Stab-Lok,\u0027 which we know is a fire hazard and needs to go. Outside, the grounding rod clamp is snapped off and loose. Also, the master bedroom ceiling fan is shaking like crazy and looks like it\u0027s mounted to a regular plastic box, not a fan-rated one. Oh, and the dryer is on a 3-prong cord but the outlet is 4-prong, they just shoved it in. Needs a proper 4-wire cord swap.\"",

More detailed assessment needed.\n\n\n**Developing the Report Structure**\n\nI\u0027m now outlining the report. I\u0027ll include an Executive Summary, Detailed Observations by area with NEC references, and a Final Verdict. My focus is on safety and code compliance. Recent additions include NEC references for the Kitchen GFCI, Exposed Wiring in the Garage, the FPE panel, Grounding Rod connection, and the ceiling fan.\n\n\n**Analyzing Safety Issues**\n\nI\u0027ve just added several key findings. The Federal Pacific Electric panel is a critical safety concern, needing immediate replacement. The outdated wiring in the kitchen and garage are also very concerning. Additional issues include the improper dryer cord installation and lack of required grounding. The full report\u0027s introduction, observations, and conclusion are nearing completion.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Code Violations**\n\nI\u0027ve just added several new deficiencies to my report. The countertop receptacles in the kitchen lack required GFCI protection, violating NEC 210.8(A)(6). Also, deteriorated cloth-jacketed wires in the garage present an arcing risk due to physical damage (NEC 300.4/334.15(B)). The existing ceiling fan box does not meet safety standards (NEC 314.27(C)), a major hazard.\n\n\n**Highlighting Critical Deficiencies**\n\nI\u0027ve just pinpointed two critical electrical deficiencies. First, the dryer in the laundry area has a 3-wire cord on a 4-wire receptacle, creating a shock risk. Second, the grounding electrode conductor clamp is damaged, compromising the grounding system. These require immediate attention.\n\n\n**Summarizing Key Concerns**\n\nI\u0027m synthesizing the report\u0027s core electrical problems, categorizing them by severity. Immediate fixes include the FPE panel and dryer cord issues. Moderate concerns are the lack of GFCI in the kitchen and the damaged grounding clamp.
